"
A Hy source code pretty-printer.

The basic algorithm is as Picolisp does:
> If an expression is atomic or has a size less or equal to 12, then print it.
> Otherwise, print a left parenthesis, recurse on the CAR, then recurse
> on the elements in the CDR, each on a new line indented by 3 spaces.
> Finally print a right parenthesis.

Here we use 2 spaces for indentation (by default).
There are a special cases about when not to break to the next line,
to handle paired `cond`, `let` assignments, etc.

Comments are discarded by the reader, so are lost.
The Hy Expressions (forms) keep information about their original
position (`f.start-column`, `f.start-line` etc.) so it is possible,
in principle, to reconstruct them.
